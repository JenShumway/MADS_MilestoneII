# MADS Milestone II: Maternal Mortality Predictors within the US and Other Nations

Milestone II project exploring maternal mortality in developed nations

By Jennifer Shumway, Justin Barry, and Saad Monem

## Intro

This project intends to provide a detailed look into the factors that contribute to maternal mortality across the world, including health and societal indicators, with a focus on understanding the US’s relatively high maternal mortality rate compared to other developed nations. We use maternal mortality rates per nation as our ground truth and aim to find additional information regarding top reasons for overall maternal mortality based on the data available.
